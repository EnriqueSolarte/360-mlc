This is the official implementation of 360-MLC, where we propose a novel approach to fine-tune and evaluate pre-trained layout estimation models on new datasets with domain shifts, and, more importantly, no ground truth is required.

## Installation 

The current implementation uses `python 3.7` and `Pytorch 1.13`. For convenience, we recommend using conda, miniconda, pyenv or any environment tool to keep isolate this implementation. 

```sh
# Create and activate conda env (mlc) 
conda create -n mlc python=3.7 
conda activate mlc 

# Install Pytorch
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Assuming $HOME directory by default
cd ~/
# clone 360-MLC (Note that we have added HorizonNet as a submodule)
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:EnriqueSolarte/360-mlc.git

cd ~/360-mlc

# Install python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install MLC library
pip install .
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this implementation is the **MP3D-FPE** dataset released by [(Solarte et al. 2019 RA-L)](https://enriquesolarte.github.io/360-dfpe/). 
To process this dataset, we have prepared a script for you `data/process_mp3d_fpe_data.py -h`. Please follow the next commands:

```sh 
MP3D_FPE_DIR="<MP3D_FPE dataset directory>"
python data/process_mp3d_fpe_data.py --path $MP3D_FPE_DIR
```

## How to create 360-mlc labels 

To create pseudo labels based on a pre-trained model, you must use `main_create_mlc_labels.py -h` by following the next commands: 

```sh
CKPT=zind # e.g. mp3d, zind, st3d or panos2d3d
python main_create_mlc_labels.py --ckpt $CKPT --cfg ./config/create_mlc_labels.yaml
```

To download `ckpt` pre-trained models, you can refer to the official pre-trained models in [HorizonNet](https://github.com/sunset1995/HorizonNet/tree/4eff713f8d446c53c479d86b4d06af166b724a74#:~:text=testing%20for%20HorizonNet.-,Pretrained%20Models,-resnet50_rnn__panos2d3d.pth).

After to download a `ckpt` model, you need to modify accordingly the cfg file `config/trained_models.yaml`. Finally, after to generate your mlc-labels (e.g. hn_mp3d__mp3d_fpe__mlc), you may have to update the cfg file `config/mvl_data.yaml`. 


## Self-training

To self-trained a model into a new dataset, e.g MP3D-FPE, you need two main requirements: (1) a pre-trained models and (2) generated mlc pseudo labels. Please check [How to create 360-mlc labels](##How-to-create-360-mlc-labels) for more information.

For self-training using 360-MLC, we have prepared two scripts `main_train_w_iou_val.py -h` and `main_train.py -h`. To self-train, follow the next commands:

```sh
python main_train_w_iou_val.py --ckpt $CKPT --cfg ./config/train_mlc.yaml --mlc hn_${CKPT}__mp3d_fpe__mlc

python main_train.py --ckpt $CKPT --cfg ./config/train_mlc.yaml --mlc hn_${CKPT}__mp3d_fpe__mlc
```
## Global directories
All data is saved at `.assets/` diretory by default. However, you can modify this in `./config/train_mlc.yam` and `./config/create_mlc_labels.yaml` in the parameter `dir`, e.g.:

```sh 
dirs: 
  mp3d_fpe_dir: ${workspace_dir}/assets/mp3d_fpe_dataset
  mlc_label_dir: ${workspace_dir}/assets/mlc_labels
  output_dir: ${workspace_dir}/assets/mlc_results
```
